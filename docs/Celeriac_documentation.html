    <!-- Introduction -->
    <h3 class="section">.NET Front-End Celeriac</h3>
    <p>The .NET front end for Daikon, named Celeriac, creates datatrace (.dtrace)
     files by examining .NET programs, modifying them in-memory, and running them.
    </p>
    <p> Before Celeriac can be run you must first set the path to the Celeriac DLL
     as an environmental variable, CELERIAC_HOME. Celeriac expects the reflector
     to be saved to CELERIAC_HOME/Celeriac.dll.
    </p>
    <p>To use Celeriac, call the launcher, CeleriacLauncher.exe then any Celeriac-arguments,
    then the path to your program, followed by any arguments for your program.
    If you would normally run
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      MyProgram.exe arg1 arg2 arg3
    </pre>
    <p class="noindent">then instead you would run
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
      CeleriacLauncher.exe MyProgram.exe arg1 arg2 arg3
    </pre>
    <p class="noindent">This runs your program and creates MyProgram.dtrace
     in a sub-directory daikon-output/ from the current directory
    </p>
    <p>That's all there is to it! Celeriac instruments your program's IL
     when the CLR is loaded, so you do not normally need to perform separate instrumentation
     and recompilation steps.
    </p>

    <p>The section lists the optional command-line arguments to Celeriac, which appear

    <!-- Program point options -->		
    <h5 class="subsection">Program points in Celeriac output</h5>
    <a name="Program-points-in-Celeriac-output"></a>
    <p>This section lists options that affect which program points appear
     in Celeriac Output.
    </p>
    <dl>		
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--ppt-omit-pattern=<var>regexp</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Do not produce data trace output for
         classes/procedures/program points whose names match the given
         regular expression. This reduces the size of the data trace
         file and also may make the instrumented program run faster,
         since it need not output those variables.</p>
        <p>This option works just like --ppt-select-pattern does,
         except that matching program points are excluded, not
         included.</p>
         <p>Omit takes precedence over select.</p>
      </dd>		

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--ppt-select-pattern=<var>regexp</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Only produce trace output for classes/procedures/program points
        whose names match the given regular expression. This option may be
        supplied multiple times, and may be used in conjunction with
        <samp><span class="option">--ppt-omit-pattern</span></samp></p>
        <p>When this switch is supplied, filtering occurs in the following
         way: for each program point, Celeriac checks the fully qualified
         class name, the method name, and the program point name
         against each <var>regexp</var> that was supplied. If any of these match,
         then the program point is included in the instrumentation.
        </p>
        <p>Suppose that method bar is defined only in class C. Then to
         trace only bar, you could match the method name (in any
         class) with regular expression ‘bar$’, or you could match
         the program point name with ‘C\.bar\(’.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--sample-start=<var>sample-cnt</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>When this option is chosen, Celeriac will record each program point until
        that program point has been executed <var>sample-cnt</var> times.  Celeriac will
        then begin sampling.  Sampling starts at 10% and decreases by a factor
        of 10 each time another <var>sample-cnt</var> samples have been recorded.  If
        <var>sample-cnt</var> is 0, then all calls will be recorded.</p>
      </dd>		

    </dl>
    <hr/>
    <!-- Variable options -->		
    <h5 class="subsection">Variables in Celeriac output</h5>
    <a name="Variables-in-Celeriac-output"></a>
    <p>This section lists options that affect which variables appear
     in Celeriac Output
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--arrays-only=<var>true|false</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Determines whether variables that implement IList should be treated as arrays
        for purposes of instrumentaion. This will affect whether the variable's elements are
        inspected, e.g. a[0], ..., a[n]. False by default.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--is-property-flags</span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>When specified will add the flag is_property to the list of flags that
        are printed for Pure methods variables that are getter
        properties. This requires still that the properties be specified in a
        purity file found with the --purity-file argument.
        Be aware that this will not work with old versions of Daikon because they
        did not use the is_property flag.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--nesting-depth=<var>n</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>				
        <p>Depth to which to examine structure components (default 2).
         This parameter determines which variables the front end causes
         to be output at runtime. For instance, suppose that a program
         contained the following data structures and variables:
         </p>
         <pre class="example">
          class A {
            int x;
            B b;
          }
          class B {
            int y;
            int z;
          }
          A myA;

          class Link {
            int val;
            Link next;
          }
          Link myList;
        </pre>

        <ul>
          <li>If depth=0, only the identities (hashcodes) of <code>myA</code> and
          <code>myList</code> would be examined; those variables could be determined to
          be equal or not equal to other variables.
          </li><li>If depth=1, then also <code>MyA.b</code>, <code>myList.next</code>, and the integers
          <code>myA.x</code> and <code>myList.val</code> would be examined.
          </li><li>If depth=2, then also <code>MyA.b.y</code>, <code>MyA.b.y</code>,
          <code>myList.next.next</code>, and <code>myList.next.val</code> would be examined.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Values whose value is undefined are not examined.  For instance, if <code>myA</code>
            is <code>null</code> on a particular execution of a program point, then
            <code>myA.b</code> is not accessed on that execution regardless of the depth
            parameter.  That variable appears in the <samp><span class="file">.dtrace</span></samp> file, but its
            value is marked as nonsensical.<br/>
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--omit-var=<var>regex</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        Do not include variables whose name matches the regular
         expression. Variables will be omitted from each program
         point in which they appear.
        </p>
      </dd>


      <dt><samp><span class="option">--purity-file=<var>pure-methods-file</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          File <var>pure-methods-file</var> lists the pure methods (sometimes called observer
          methods) in a .NET program. Pure methods have no externally-visible side effects, such as setting  variables or producing output. For example, most implementations of the
          <code>GetHashCode()</code>,
          <code>ToString()</code>, and <code>EqualsTo()</code> methods are pure, as are
          automatically generated getters.
        </p><p>
          For each variable, Celeriac adds to the trace
          new “fields” that represent invoking each pure method on the variable.

          (Obviously this mechanism is only useful for methods that return a value: a pure
          method that returns no value does nothing!)
        </p>
          Here is an example:
        <pre>
           class Point {
             private int x, y;
              public int RadiusSquared() {
                return x*x + y*y;
              }
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
        If <code>radiusSquared()</code> has been specified as pure, then for each point <var>p</var>,
        Celeriac will output
        the variables <var>p</var>.<code>x</code>, <var>p</var>.<code>y</code>, and
        <var>p</var><code>.RadiusSquared()</code>. Use of pure methods can improve the Daikon
        output, since they represent information that the programmer considered important but that
        is not necessarily stored in a variable.
        </p><p>
        Invoking a pure method at any time in an application should not change the application's
        behavior. If a non-pure method is listed in a purity file, then application behavior can change.
        Celeriac does not verify the purity of methods listed in the purity file.
        </p><p>
        The purity file lists a set of methods, one per line. The format of each method is given as follows: </p>
        <pre>
        [AssemblyQualifiedName];[MethodName]
        </pre>
        For example:
        <pre>
          PureMethods.A, PureMethods, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null;PureMethod1
        </pre>
        <p>
        By convention, pure-methods-file has the suffix .pure.
        </p>
      </dd>


      <dt><samp><span class="option">--std-visibility</span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>When this switch is on, Celeriac will traverse exactly
         those fields that are visible from a given program point.
         For instance, only the public fields of class pack1.B will
         be included at a program point for class pack2.A whether
         or not pack1.B is instrumented. By default, Celeriac outputs
         all fields in instrumented classes (even those that would
         not be accessible in Java code at the given program point)
         and outputs no fields from uninstrumented classes (even
         those that are accessible).
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- Misc. options -->		
    <h5 class="subsection">Celeriac miscellaneous options</h5>
    <a name="Celeriac-miscellaneous-options"></a>

    <p>This section lists all other Celeriac options - that is, all options
    that do not control which program points and variables appear in Celeriac's
    output.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><samp><span class="option">--assembly-name=<var>assembly</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>				
        <p>Specify the name of the assembly to be profiled. If not specified, the assembly
        name will be inferred as the name of the executable, preceding any extension.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--output-location=<var>filename</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>				
        <p>Specifies the for the trace output (.dtrace)
         file. If this is not specified, then the default value of
         daikon-output/PROGRAMNAME.dtrace is used
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--save-program=<var>filename</var></span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Instead of executing the program, save it as
         <var>filename</var>, or InstrumentedProgram.exe if filename
         is no supplied. This new program can then be executed, and will
         write its output as normal. This is useful for debugging purposes,
         to examine the program with all instrumentation calls inserted, or
         to verify the bytecode.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--force-unix-newline</span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Always use the UNIX newline character. If not specified the
         OS default newline character will be used. This is necessary
         for passing the unit tests.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--dtrace-append</span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Instead of deleting the existing dtrace file, append the
         results of this run to the end of the existing file, if any.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--enum-underlying-values</span></samp></dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Instead of printing the string representation of an Enum's
         value, print the underlying integral-type value.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt><samp><span class="option">--linked-lists</span></samp></dt>
      <dd><p>This boolean option (default: true) causes user-defined linked lists to
        be output as sequences, much like Java ‘<samp><span class="samp">List</span></samp>’s and arrays are.
        A user-defined data structure is considered to be a linked list if it
        has one instance field that is of its own type.
